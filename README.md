This is a simple example of a React+Redux-based recipe management application I created for a recent
[online class](https://www.codementor.io/classes/learn-reactjs-and-redux-live).

## How to run
First, please install node modules.
```
# install node modules
npm i
```
Second, run the api server.
```
npm run api
```
Third, run the webpack dev server.
```
npm start
```
Now you can see the webapp at `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.
